Riley Woodruff Personal Website Journal

Mar 10:
    I'm starting on my project now (maybe a little later than I should).
I'm thinking about making the project fairly traditional with a navbar on top 
that links to an about me, my resume, my projects, and a contact form.
There will be a picture that's kinda stylized of me and I'll deploy from github.
