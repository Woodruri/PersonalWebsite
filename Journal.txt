Mar 10:
    I'm starting on my project now (maybe a little later than I should).
I'm thinking about making the project fairly traditional with a navbar on top 
that links to an about me, my resume, my projects, and a contact form.
There will be a picture that's kinda stylized of me and I'll deploy from github.

Mar 11:
    I'm hoping to finish up my html by the end of the day.
My current plan is to have a header than links to different spots on the same 
page in this order from top to bottom: About me, resume, projects, and a little
contact form on the bottom. I want each section to have a little picture to the side
that alternates sides in a pattern like this

[picture][text info]
[text info][picture]
...

etc.

Mar 14: I honestly haven't made much progress but I am hoping to do all of the html today
and finish up with Javascript and css 

Mar 14 update: I made a ton of progress, bootstrap is pretty neat.

Mar 14 udpate #2: I made even more progress and basically have the project done.
Right now I am just messing around with some fun javascript stuff

Mar 14 udpate #3: I have finished the project entirely and am about to turn it in.
I had way too much fun in the last little bit making a little easter egg.
Whoever my grader is I ask that you look around for a bit and see if you can find it
